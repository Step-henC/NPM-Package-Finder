# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In terminal run `npx create-react-app {app-name} --template typescript

## What Is this
Simple app that consumes npmjs api to search npm packages. Built with React-Redux-Typescript

## How To Run 

Clone and `npm install` the app and then run `npm start` at root directory to see app running at `localhost:3000` in browser. 


## Let me see how it works.

The video shows how this app handles loading, data and errors. In the video, I turn off network and go offline to force and error to show on screen. In the end, you npm packages for any search
